Owl Folk. An associate of [[Cedrik]], aquaintance of [[Vetri]],.

In [[../Sessions/Session 1|Session 1]], he was found dead inside a warehouse in Old Warf.

After the investigation done by the party Sessions [[../Sessions/Session 2|2]] and [[../Sessions/Session 3|3]], they found a holy artifact of [[Varkanus]] in a magically locked vault in his apartment, along with a letter from "Xarakos" that read: 

_"CANDLEWYND YOUR BORROWED TIME IS COMING TO A CLOSE. GIVE US THE HOLY FIGURE. GIVE US THE ALPHABET. VARKANUS HIMSELF REQUIRES TO MEET YOU AGAIN. THE EXHIBITION MUST CONTINUE."_

Based on this information, along with information they got from [[../Carminus/Selda Hightower|Selda]] in [[../Sessions/Session 6|Session 6]], Edgar deduced that Martin had collected both the "The Alphabet", and the holy symbol of Varkanus, both of which the cult seemed to need for a ritual. When meeting with the cult at the warehouse, he only took one of the artifacts, thinking that would guarantee his safety while he was taken to meet with Varkanus. He was proven wrong, when he was killed with necrotic magic, likely by a member of the [[The City/Cult of Varkanus|Cult of Varkanus]].
