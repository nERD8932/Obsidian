We start the session with some of the gang waking up at Edgars apartment. They then meet up at a nearby breakfast joint called the Birch Coffee House, where they drink some coffee and eat some food, before they head to [Carminus Universum](/Images/Carminus%20Universum.jpg) to confront Selda about her meeting with Rico Ratti Jr . While they don't have a plan, Silvius does make it a point to ask the gang to not harm her, if its avoidable. 

They head towards the college, where Silvius first meets up with Nora, catching her up to the stuff he's been up to recently. She's simply happy to meet Cedrik, who again offers his financial support for "Bora"s artistic endeavors. They also ask for her help in bringing Selda to them, so that they can have a conversation with her. Nora feels a little iffy about the plan, because the group doesn't have a concrete idea of what they really want out of the conversation. At this point, professor Clara seems to spot Cedrik with her Favored Foe, and comes over to ask the gang why they're here. Silvius tells her about their findings, while the gang makes possibly the worst first impression on her, which she promptly blames on their connection to Cedrik. She then offers some advice, and tells them that they may go through more official means, by her or Professor Kalista asking Selda questions. The gang considers this, and tells her that they'd contact her if they choose to go that route. She leaves after telling them to "not go too far".

To retroactively explain their choice, the idea of going through official means to corner [Selda Hightower](/Carminus/Selda%20Hightower.md) would a. Reveal the extent of their knowledge and involvement to others, which may put them at risk too, and b. Likely not result in any substantial help, due to the lack of evidence they have on her and her connection to Rico.

They decide to follow Selda to wherever she's headed, and impersonate have her meet with an impersonated [Rico Ratti Jr](/The%20City/Rico%20Ratti%20Jr.md), in hopes of getting some information about their mutual connection to the cult. 

They then follow her to West Sombus Train Terminal, where Silvius disguises himself as [Rico Ratti Jr](/The%20City/Rico%20Ratti%20Jr.md) and Cedrik disguises himself as a general Ratti thug. They sit down with her where "Silco" tries to get information out of her. She seems a bit deceptive of his demeanor due to a really high insight roll, but doesn't have any proof. She tells Silco that they should go meet Varkanus right now, since they're already there. 

This obviously interests Silco and Cedratti. They follow her to the center of the concourse, where she says "Three tickets to madness.". The three of them instantly teleport to a different plane of existance, where they see a large eye right behind them. Selda prompts Silco to look into the eye, which he doesn't do. By this point, the party, who thanks to Esther and Miri, saw and heard the three of them teleport away, used the passphrase they heard Selda use, and follow them inside. Combat ensues as Selda summons an Aboleth Spawn. 

After a somewhat challenging combat, where Vetri lands multiple crits, Silvius gets the final blow on Selda, knocking her out. 

Something seems to compel Vetri to take out the holy figurine of Varkanus. When she does, she hears a voice speak in Abyssal as the eye at the center of the station seems to focus directly on her. It asks her who she is. The voice then says she is marked, and is destined to die. Silvius senses that something is off about Vetri and quickly knocks the figurine out of her hand. Upon doing this, Vetri returns to her senses. She relays the information she heard from the voice to the party. 

Afterwards, Cedrik uses a party of Selda's hair, which was expertly but poorly cut by Esther, in lieu of the body part of an evil humanoid, which he needed to conduct the ritual to deepen his connection to Karael. Upon burning the offerings, he breathes in the infernal fumes. He's branded on his arms by celestial runes written in infernal script. He feels the flame within him get stronger.

The party then heals Selda only to start interrogating her. While she is clearly stalling for time, she doesn't seem to be lying; only misleading. After some casual rage baiting by both sides (mainly Selda and Esther), she tells the party about the eye, and how its a way for the cult to be in direct contact with Varkanus, and also tells them the names of Trixie, the artificer who likely controlled the Cogwork Archivist, and Xarkos, who the party knew of, but never knew of his connection to Selda or others. 

By this time, other members of the cult have arrived including a tall paladin dressed in a plague doctorâ€™s outfit named Yulis. which is revealed to them by an alarm spell Vetri had set up.

They quickly intimidate Selda into giving up the passcode to leave, which was "the number" conjoined with "tickets to sanity". Silvius, who thought the number three was likely special in some way said the passcode with that, teleporting him and the two closest party members out. The rest followed suite. Once outside, they quickly make their way out. The session ends with them deciding to have everyone disperse for the time being, but meet up at the Gwynne manor for the sake of safety.
