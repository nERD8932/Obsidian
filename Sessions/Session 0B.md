[[Cedrik]] gives lecture at the University when asked by [[Clara Gwynne]]

The lecture went well, Norah and Silvius approached Cedrik afterwards.

[[Norah Ward]] and [[Silvius]] take Cedrik to their studio after the lecture 

Norah nudges Silvius to draw Cedrik, which results in Silvius's magic and Cedriks "true form"s magic to intermingle and end up forming this goopy paint abomination 

The abomination spawns from the sketchpad and tries to take the form of an angel.

After fighting the abomination, Silvius heals Cedrik, who misleads them about the origin of the abomination, and offers patronage to both of them.

Later, Nora talks to Silvius about her reservations about what Cedrik said about the origin of the abomination being due to "Firbolg reasons"

"The True Essence":
At the Gwynne Manor in Faithills, Sir Cedrik Gwynne had breakfast with his similarly old orc butler named Azukk Tuskon. Azukk told him that he received a letter from his ex-wife, which requested him to give a guest lecture at the Carminus Universum about his art collection. He agreed to go tomorrow.
The next day, Silvius Esmer-Gradus met his best friend and classmate Norah Ward at the cafeteria while sketching away. She told him about the guest lecture in the evening, and they discussed the possibility that this "Sir Gwynne" is the ex-husband of their head teacher, "Ms. Clara Gwynne". Cedrik showed up to the CU campus by evening with three of his prized paintings to talk about. He met his ex-wife Clara as well as another professor named Loras Runestrong who was very excited to meet him. Cedrik gave a good lecture about historical artworks, and after the lecture Norah and Silvius went up to talk to him. Cedrik recognised Silvius as the son of two world-famous artists, Merwin Gradus & Zuria Esmer. Norah invited Cedrik to their Art Studio to see the facilities. There, Silvius and Cedrik critiqued Norah's work in progress artwork, before she suggested Silvius should speed-paint Cedrik. Silvius' innate magic of painting the true essence of people interacted wrongly with Cedrik's true innate self, as the paint came to life and leapt out of the painting. The paint ooze tried to turn into an angel, but since that is forbidden by divine laws, it just turned into a roaring monster. Cedrik protected the kids by anchoring the paint fiend in place so it wasn't able to move, but got hurt badly in the process. Norah threw paint-remover on the monster, and Silvius finally got inspired to do something in this first ever real combat and erased the monster from existence. Cedrik lied to the kids that this happened because of them painting a Firbolg and not something specific to him. He offered to sponsor their art careers, which Norah agreed readily due to not being from a rich background. After Cedrik left, she and Silvius discussed that it couldn't have been due to Firbolg magic as they paint Ms. Clara all the time. Cedrik took the long way back to his mansion in the tram, and was unable to keep the voices out of his head that day. By the time he reached late at night, Tuskon helped give him some medical attention before leaving for the night.
