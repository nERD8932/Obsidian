"Jazz Cabaret":
In the eastern city on a weekend, [Miri](/Party/Miri.md)woke up in the shop of her two adopted dads, "Tempest Artificery". Her gnome dad cooked the food while she reminded her dwarf dad to come eat. It was the weekend, so she was going to go to the cabaret Ruby Knightclub that day. Her parents were worried and didn't want her to continue working at the mafia-owned club. Gnome Dad reminded her that the carnival was coming in a month or two, and she could hopefully perform there instead. In the northeastern part of Fayshine, Esther Bishop left her flat and was greeted by the various townspeople of her neighborhood. A taco-stand seller dragonborn named Gyhan gave her a free taco, but was worried about an explosion last week and asked if they were in danger from the Roja Cartel. Esther reassured him and the others that the Rubino family had it handled and it wouldn't hurt them. She was then called through her ruby sending stone to the Knightclub by her friend, Capo Luciano Caballero. That evening, Luciano introduced Esther to Miri at the club. He talked to Esther about a favor he was doing for a friend next weekend in the West City, which was Ratti turf. He didn't assume it to be dangerous, but let her know his location regardless just in case. When the singer Rebecca Booth started performing, she was poisoned on stage and turned into an aberrant body-horror monster, her spine bursting out of her back to become wings. Her shriek paralyzed half the people there and the other half fled the club. Esther, Miri, and Luciano put up a good fight against the monstrous Rebecca, Esther doing a lot of damage as Miri prevented them from being hurt. After killing her, Miri discovered a broken Abyssal brooch on Rebecca's body. Luciano wondered if this was a cartel hit on him, but this didn't fit their style. He gave Miri a bonus of a hundred gold and sent her home, and asked Esther to reach out to a "Diego". Miri reached home late at night, and DwarfDad was both happy for her earning that day and also worried due to her promotion in the mafia club.
