We start the session off right where we left off. The party had beaten up Elijah and his lackeys. As the gang is tying them up, they see campus police approach them. Biz and Jonner go up to them and persuade them to call the police, specifically Rorax. 

The campus police do exactly that. A few minutes later, the actual police shows up along with Inspector Rorax. There, Rorax asks them why the party beat up this random Jock.  "Jonner" and Biz explain the situation and Elijah's connection to the cult of blood. After Jonner gets a face full of fire from Elijah for the sin of asking him to be reasonable, he is taken away in a muzzle.

The part of the party then decides to attend a public lecture being held by professor Hightower. Esther and Vetri however chose to sneak into Triston's office to find some connection of his to the cult. Esther is able to spot a Professor's Crystal Ball, and Triston's wizard staff. They end up stealing both. After the lecture is over, the party meets up, where Silvius informs them of the severity of what they've stolen, and its potential consequences. They decide they'll pawn the items off to their trusted contact, Kumoko Hana. They do so, and end up buying some items while they're at it.

Edgar, Silvius and Vetri spend their Sunday working their way through the two books they got from Trixie. All three gain an understanding of demonology that will help them in the future.

The next day, the party heads to Roja island, where the Seven's Carnival is being held. At the carnival, the gang sees all varieties of performers, juggling hoops, breathing fire, and even fire breathing dragons. They also see the Troupemaster:

Seven is an arch-fey that has been holding the Seven's Carnival for hundreds of years. He makes a speech welcoming everyone, talking about the 7 days of festivities to follow. He then disappears in a green flash of fire.

Miri also notices The Great Fairy Bard Toffee, one of their main inspirations growing up. He's to have a performance later this week:![../Images/Toffee1.webp](/Images/Toffee1.webp)

As the party is roaming around, participating in the festivities, they encounter a Triton by the name of Vundus Valexath of the Seven's Carnival.

He seems to be challenging adventurers and parties into fighting waves of sharks, for a prize of 60k gold coins. The party (with some more interested than others) end up participating. They make easy work of the first two waves of sharks, after which they fight a Aberrant Shark, summoned by Vundus. They take care of the aberrant as well, and earn themselves 60k gold and a roaring applause from the crowd. 

Edgar, thinking he could maybe pry this Triton, Vundus about his involvement with the cult of Varkanus, if any, goes to ask him a question. With Miri's help and Cedriks intuition, Edgar is able to fool Vundus into thinking he's a member of the cult. Vundus, looking almost un-phased, hugs Edgar and tells him to meet him alone in his tent after the days festivities end.

After this exchange, Miri ends up meets their parents, Dubon & Fizz Tempest, who praise her for her performance against the sharks. They also meet the rest of the party, thanking Cedrik for hiring their daughter. They also tell Miri that they arranged for them to give a performance at the carnival tomorrow. Miri is gob struck, but clarifies to their concerned parents that they're overjoyed. As part of the lead up to the performance, Miri also needs to talk to: 

Esma, the Tropemaster's Assistant

Miri and Dubon head into Esma's office, where she gives Miri the details of when they'll perform. Esma also tells them that their parents paid Esma 2000 gold coins, and that they'd need to attract a crowd of a few thousand to break even, or even make some money. Miri tells her they might need some back up vocalists or instruments, which Esma agrees to.

Meanwhile, Esther meets her ex-Rubino ex-boyfriend, Diego PÃ©on

Diego used to be part of the Rubino family, but at some point after their break up left the Rubino family and started working for the Roja family instead. They talk about Luciano, and his cause of death. Esther also asks him about who might have a grudge against Tengai Rin. She explains how she's being framed for the murder of Tengai Rin's wife, even though the death itself was ruled a suicide. Diego doesn't know anyone in his family that would want to frame, or kill, Esther, at the moment. He also warns her about other murders that might occur, if someone really is out to frame her.

Esther also asks him about Varkanus cultists in the city, and if there are any at the festival. She lists off some names, out of which Deigo only recognizes Vundus, the Triton they met earlier. He clarifies that Vundus is like  Kumoko Hana but for the troupe.

The session ends as Esther, Vetri, and Silvius tell Edgar of their plan of sneakily following him to Vundus's tent, where he was invited alone.
