We start the session off on the morning after the exhibition. Edgar is sound asleep in his office/apartment, where he dreams of a 17 year old memory, when he was 11 years old. He sees Berion meet his mother, giving her some work related documents. He then introduced himself to Edgar, calling himself Allan, his father's, best friend. The dream then turns slightly nightmarish where he witnesses the incidents preceding his fathers death. He sees the invasion of the Dark Hunt and the destruction it caused, and also sees Berion rummaging through the rubble.

We then cut to Sombus General Hospital, where Vetri wakes up around 7am and meets Viraj as she drinks her coffee. Viraj talks about yesterdays events, and leaves soon after. 

Afterwards, Vetri and Silvius start interrogating Jonner. Jonner tells them that he was forced into doing this by the Church of Blood, who we're threatening this grandmother. He says the church actively recruits people at the university. He was introduced into the church by Elijah Hunt, who Silvius knows to be a Jock Paladin. He also asks them to check up on his grandmother, which they do. The grandmother offers them breakfast, but they politely decline. They then head to the Gwynne manor.

The party meets up in the dining hall, where everyone is getting ready for breakfast. After talking about where they should build an indoor swimming pool in the manor, Silvius catches everyone up about Jonner and the information he gave. Azukk, who's been listening in on the conversation about Elijah brings up the fact that his daughter is also a Paladin enrolled in the same university course as him. The party is slightly reluctant to involve another person with anything related to the cult or church, but Azukk assures them that she can take care of herself. They decide to head to the university where Silvius would lure Elijah out by using disguise self, while the rest of the party watches over. They also talk about Headmaster of the Carminus Universum: Arandor Wizardson, an extremely old Arch mage.

Afterwards, we see Miri, who goes home to talk to his parents. Their Gnome dad is reading the newspaper, which mentions a "fairy" helping Cedrik Gwynne, who they know as Miri's boss, at the moment. Gnome dad asks Miri about this, which Miri lies about. They somehow believe Miri, but tells them to be careful all the same.

In the meantime, Silvius goes back home once before heading to the university with the party. There, he's greeted by his butler, who also lets him know that his parents arrived last night. He immediately goes to meet them. He greets and hugs them, and also asks them about their work.

Zuria tell him that they got done a bit early, so they took an airship home. Merwin then ask Silvius about the exhibition yesterday, which he found out about in the newspaper. Since Silvius hasn't read the newspaper yet, he was caught off guard. He however is able to convince his parents that he's being safe. and that what happened was just a coincidence. They tell him to be more careful, since the city is a bit unsafe at the moment. His parents also bring up the deaths of Loras and Martin, who they knew. Silvius senses that they seem to know more about this than they're letting on, but isn't able to get much out of them. He then lets his parents know that he'll be taking some money out of the bank, and leaves before he can be questioned about it.

We then cut to Edgar and Esther, who're heading to meet Berion, who told Edgar to visit him sometime. Edgar brings up his dream/memory to Esther, about the Dark Hunt, and Berion rummaging through the the rubble. He also shows Esther his father journal, which talks about Martin Candlewynd and Berion Goldquill. Afterwards, they meet Berion. Edgar shows Berion the journal his father Allan kept. Berion skims through the journal. He is visibly emotional at certain sections. 

Bernion talks about the incidents that led up to his fathers death. About how Allan went to meet Martin's contacts, some Athien Tridens for an artifact. About how he was out of town when Allan died, but spent a week trying bring justice to this clear murder. About how he soon realized that he was incapable of doing so, without probably getting himself killed as well. So he chose silence. 

Esther asks him about what he found out about what he found out during the week of investigation, which he seems somewhat reluctant to talk about.

Edgar brings up the memory of Berion visiting his house when the Dark Hunt invaded, and about how he was rummaging through his destroyed house's rubble.  Berion looked visibly startled. He tells Edgar about how he was hoping to find something he could use to find the truth behind Allan's murder. He had asked Edgar's mother for work documents and anything else that might be relevant. She gave him the documents she found, but also mentions a locked safe that Allan kept. Berion tells Edgar that he was looking for the contents of the safe in the rubble.

Berion then tells them to walk with them. He takes them into his apartment, where they see that very safe. Berion mentions in the different ways he's tried to have the safe opened, clearly to no avail. The safe can only be opened with a magical key word. Edgar says he's confident that he can deduce the password, and is told by Berion that he can take it with him. After some more conversation, where Berion eludes to either Vetri or Oscar being promoted down the road, they go their separate ways.

Finally, we cut to Cedrik and Vetri, who head towards Trixie's hideout/lab to catch up with her. The lab is in Noxham, where they stand out like... well, like nobles in a slum. They make their way to the address Trixie gave them, while keeping their valuables close to them. After knocking on the door for some time, Vetri reaches for her gun to shoot the door open, which is when Trixie opens the door. She invites them in. Inside, they see an extremely large mech, likely the one she was talking about back in the abandoned mines.

Trixie talks about how the mech can be piloted by two people (albeit two short people). 
After talking about the mech some more, she gives the two books she stole from the museum to Vetri. 

1. History of Demonology 
2. The Black Scrolls of Vark
   
They decide that they'll tell the cult that as a security policy, the museum only kept a fake version of the book. Trixie also gave them a sending stone that they can use to contact her from now on.

Back at the Gwynne manor, Cedrik hears Karael call out to him. Karael talks to Cedrik about the cult and their recent activities. He says those "kids" are playing with powers they can't conceive. He says that this mortal age has forgotten the power that Vanos the serpent held. He was feared by the gods himself, and that MUST NOT be resurrected, as it would spell trouble for everyone, including Karael. Cedrik agrees with him, and asks him about his interaction with Vanos. Karael tells him that he was still an angel back when Vanos was imprisoned. Cedrik is surpised that Karael wishes to avoid Cedrik dying at the hand of someone more powerful, considering that it would give Karael a more powerful host to work with. Karael clarifies that Vanos in specific is closer to a god than a mortal, and the enchantments that bind him to Cedrik are meant specifically for mortals. He doesn't know how it would react to someone like Vanos.

The next day, the gang heads to Carminus Universum to meet Biz, Azukk's daughter, and then meet with Elijah. They also catch each other up about their day yesterday.

They find Biz in the cafeteria.

Cedrik is made to be the first point of contact, as she likely remembers him. They then discreetly ask her about Elijah, which seems to pique her curiosity. The party tries to tell her what they can without getting her too involved, but she seems adamant to know more. After a lot of convincing on both sides, they decide that she'll introduce a disguised Silvius to Elijah, to maintain plausible deniability regarding her involvement with the party.

They then try to enact this plan. Silvius and Cedrik disguise themselves as a random students, with Biz taking "Jonner" aka Silvius to Elijah, while the rest of the party hides nearby. Jonner then tries to pry information out of Elijah by using Selda as a mutual connection that sent him here to meet him. Elijah seems a bit skeptical of Jonner but can't really confirm his suspicions. Elijah then notices Edgar hiding behind the stands, due to a somewhat bad stealth roll. Elijah then asks Jonner to prove his worth by casting fireball on the person spying on them. After some initial reluctance, Jonner then steps forward, and pretends to cast fireball on Edgar, while actually casting it directly on Elijah and his lackeys, catching them completely off guard. Combat ensues.

After a quick combat, where Biz ends up helping them out, Esther gets the final blow on Elijah. Both the combat and the session end as Edgar goes sicko mode on this one bloodied and paralyzed student dealing 44 damage.  They decide they'd contact Rorax and get the cultists arrested, in hopes of making it more difficult for them to recruit college students like Connor.
