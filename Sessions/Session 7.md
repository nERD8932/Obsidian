We start the session in a new month; the first Sunday of Mid-Summer. Later in the week, we have the Demonology Exhibition. We also have the Mid-Summer carnival of the new month. Since its the first day of the month, the party also gets paid their salaries and allowances today.

We focus on Edgar, who receives knock on his door. Upon opening, he sees a half-Oni, half-Tiefling woman called Tengai Rin. She says she's part of the Shinpi-Gumi Yakuza; Cinoan imigrants who've settled here in Sombus.

She says her wife was murdered last week in this city. The police, Yakuza, and other sources have stopped investigating, ruling murder out, likely attributing suicide as the cause of death. She says she wants Edgar to find the lowlife assassin who killed. Edgar asks about her appearance and more information about her, and why she would be targeted. Tengai says she was likely targeted due to her status in the Shinpi Yakuza family.

She also says she has a lead on the murderer. She pulls out a sketch, of none other than Alfieri, aka, Esther Bishop.

Edgar convinces her to wait as he conducts his investigation, not telling her about his connection to Esther. He doesn't know if she believed her or not, but gives him her home address, saying she'll be doing some investigating of her own, but expects him to find the killer first.

Once she leaves, Edgar immediately contacts Esther, asking her about the [Shinpi Yakuza](/The%20City/Shinpi%20Yakuza) and Tengai Rin, the Lieutenant of a Capo of the family. Esther clarifies that she knows of the Yakuza, but nothing about this murder, and says that she had no part in it whatsoever.  Edgar instinctively believes her, partly because Esther was WITH Edgar most of last week.

We cut back to the Gwynne manor, where we see Cedrik, Vetri and Silvius eating breakfast. Vetri is still very paranoid about her encounter with the Eye back in the train station. They discuss what to do next, and decide they'll contact and meet up with the party near the museum. Silvius also contacts Esther and asks her if she can talk to the Rubinos about the two leads they had, "Trixie" and "Xarkos".

The party meets up at Starsworth, near the Sombus Archeological Society, heading towards the museum. Everyone seems exceedingly cautious due to their encounter with the Eye. Oscar pokes Vetri as he sneaks up on the group. They talk about the progress they've made on the Cogwork Archivist. They continue to search around the museum, trying to find a location where the psyonic shard they got from Xoe would react. After around half an hour of searching, they head outside. There, Vetri notices the shard glow. It leads the to a nearby park, called Starswirl. They reach the middle of the park, where they notice the crystal stops glowing when they cross that point. Silvius and Vetri realize that there are caves underground, that used to be old mines.

With this information Vetri leads the group to a location where she suspects would give them access to the building. They see a locked shed of sorts, who's lock Silvius disintegrates. They head inside to find another such door, among gardening tools. Oscar then decides to camp out, to "keep guard". Sure buddy.

They head inside. Inside, they find old and worn out tunnels, inter linked with large sewage pipes. They follow where the shard and tunnels lead them, ultimately happening upon a structure where they see some light.

Esther casts pass without trace, and Vetri casts Invisibility to scope the area out. Inside, she finds a bunch of miner automatons, and Trixie.

The party tries to sneak in the nearby rubble and call her out to separate her from the automatons. Silvius casts prestidigitation and successfully distracts her, however one of the automatons notices this. Combat starts.

Vetri, Cedrik and Esther get multiple crits, and clean up the automatons and take Trixie down. Trixie tries to self-destruct before she gets captured, but with Silvius's Slow spell, and Esthers acrobatics, they stop her from doing so. 

Afterwards, Vetri investigates a lab, and finds a large, expensive looking arcane battery. They then tie her up, and wake her up to interrogate her. After intimidating her, casting zone of truth and Cedrik bribes her with 5k gold coins. She then tells the party about her superior and contact at the cult, Yulis. The party makes the connection between the plague-doctor they escaped from at the train station, and the name and description she mentioned. She also talks about what the cult had her looking for in the museum:

 - Varkanus Figurine
 - Book 1: "History of Demonology" (exhibited in the exhibition)
 - Book 2: "The Black Scrolls of Varkan" (exhibited in the exhibition)
 - Book 3: "Travels of the Phoenix Nebula by Elise Pearlwynd" (not exhibited and available in public libraries)

She intended to steal the books on the day of the exhibition. They put her on retainer with the gold coins and ask her to inform her when she finds those books, so that they can create fake versions to give to the cult.

The party leaves, and splits up into Cedrik, Vetri and Silvius, who head back to the manor, and Edgar and Esther, who head to Tengai Rin's house. They talk to the security guard of Rin's building about the crime that occurred last week, who seems to recognize Esther. Edgar and Esther discuss the possibility of someone using disguise self to frame Esther. They realize the murder happened two days ago. They also rule out the Rubino Family and the Shinpi Yakuza based on their respective self interests.

By this point, they notice a Crimson Faithkeeper and Police officer that seem to be eyeing the two of them. They sneak into the crowd, and quickly make their way out.

We cut back to the other group. As soon as they enter the manor, they find Gail there, standing next to Tuskon. Silvius is on high alert, challenging Gail to a 1v1, which Cedrik and Vetri synchronously stop. Gail says they're no longer being investigated for the murder of Martin Candlewynd, but threatens the parties family members, and says Vetri has until the exhibition to give it back. She heads back after Silvius rage-baits her some more.

The gang heads inside and talks about the significance of the figurine, in order to get some kind of insight into why the cult wants it. They decide it might be better to ask people that might know more about an artifact of this nature.

We then cut back to Edgar, who heads up the building to talk to Rin. Rin tells her that her wife was found with her wrists cut open, and that there were no signs of struggle. Edgar does however notice a lockpicking scratch on their door. Edgar collects some witness statements, and leaves soon after. He meets up with Esther, and talks about heading to the central city police department in Somton, the most densely populated part of town. Since they still don't know about Gail being alive and well, and head towards the department.

As they reach, they see none other than Gail, also on her way back from the mansion. Gail tells her about her encounter with the others. She also denies their request to go to the morgue. After some more conversation they head back to Gwynne manor. 

The party regroups, and mutually freak out about Gail's return. Edgar almost slips up and starts talking about the investigation with Esther, but is stopped by Esther herself. The session ends with some more banter.
