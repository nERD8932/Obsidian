We start the session with Edgar, who headed back to Castella after the team went their separate ways. Edgar was going to meet inspector Rorax, to inform him of the incident with Gail.

He jump scares Rorax, who is enjoying a sausage. Edgar tells him about Gails' relation to the cult of Varkanus, and how they killed themselves. He also shows Rorax the sketch Silvius drew of the crime scene. Rorax seemed convinced, and says that he'll keep this information to himself.

We then jump to The Gwynne manor, where we see Cedrik trying to make contact with Karael, the fallen angel inside him.

(forgot to add this last session, sorry Vijay!)

Karael had promised Cedrick "knowledge". Cedrick asks Karael about the letter they found from Martin's vault, instructing him to meet with Varkanus again. Karael determines regardless of the authenticity of this letter, it doesn't seem good. He also says Cedrick would find his answer deep under the city. He also talks about a ritual that would help make Cedrik's "flame" stronger. He mentions a few items that he would need to burn to conduct the ritual:

 - A bone from a devil (in Cedrik's collection already!) 
 - A pinch of black powder (something he can get from Vetri) 
 - A ruby
 - Ash from a dead evil humanoid's body 

The only item that he didn't have access to was the ash from an evil humanoid. Based on his investigation check, he understands that this isn't just Karael lying to him. This would genuinely strengthen his connection to Karael.

We then jump to Silvius, on the next day. He sees Nora being cornered by a common acquaintance, Selda Hightower; Noble Cleric Student

Selda seems to be bullying Nora about the rumor that Sir Cedrik Gwynne offered to sponsor Nora. SIlvius tries to invervene and convinces Selda that he did infact offer to sponsor Nora. She believes him and heads off with her lackeys. Nora seems kind of annoyed about Silvius intervening, and heads off to eat her lunch. 

Silvius heads to Professor Hightower's office, to ask him about the cult of Varkanus.

Professor Triston Hightower; Professor of Divine Studies & Planes

In his office, he finds Triston and Professor Clara having tea. Silvius asks professor Hightower about the cult of Varkanus and its presence in Sombus. He tells Silvius that the cult has not been active for at least the past sixty years. When Silvius mentions Gail killing herself, Hightower seems palpably interested. He tries to push Silvius to reveal more information, but is bailed out by Clara, who tells him to go eat lunch.

We now cut to Esther and Miri, who're at Luciano's funeral ceremony. Esther meets Luciano's ex-wife Noelia Caballero, and his son Camilo Caballero. They have a conversation with Camilo, who is curious about their relation to Luciano. Miri hands Camilo their card, and the conversation ends when Esther offers her condolences to Noelia.

They then meet the four capos of the Rubino empire, Terzo Sombosso, Basilio Tortuga, Gianna Giasivi and Esmeralda Castrillo.

Esmeralda went up to Esther to pay her condolences. They talk about the Ratti families connection to Luciano's death. Miri realizes that Esmeralda was regular at the club where they perform their shows. They also talk about the Ratti wedding that Esther and Miri plan on attending. Esmeralda entrusts Esther with Luciano's ring,

She also gives Miri something Luciano's commissioned for them; a performance outfit

Esmeralda mentions how they plan on promoting Esther to capo, and give her ownership of the club. Esther is hesitant, claiming she know if she's ready for the responsibility, and asks Esmeralda to wait till the Don returns. She reluctantly agrees.

The next day, everyone dresses up for the wedding. Edgar has to ask his land lady, Ms. Perez for a good suit, since he doesn't have one. He persuades the landlady, who offers him her late husbands suite.  Everyone meets at the sewer entrance and head towards the sewer chapel. They meet Bruno, who introduces them to some Ratti enforcers called Jamison and Carlos

Carlos

Carlos sticks a dynamite in Edgars mouth, which is promptly put out by Bruno.
They head inside the chapel. Other people they notice:

Kaya Nezumi (groom)
Rosina Ratti (younger daughter)
Rico Ratti Jr (Don's son)

Carlos leads them to the Don. They see the Don talking to Svazzall, the owner of the Planar Pub. Svazzall greets Cedrik and then heads out.

Don Ratti greets Esther "Alfieri", confused as to why she hasn't already been promoted to capo. He also offers his condolences regarding Luciano. The party members introduce themselves. Esther talks about how Don Ratti's men knew Luciano were at the Old Warf. Don Ratti refuses to give up his sources. 

Miri with the help of Silvius ends up convincing the Don to give them some information. He tells them that that his son was incharge of the raid on the harbour. 

The gang ends up joining the festivities. After a few hours, Cedrik notices Ratti Jr sneaking out of the chapel. The gang follows him. On their way there, they get ambushed by Carlos, who throws a poison bomb that does 40 damage to most of the gang. Combat ensues. Silvius, Miri and Edgar survive the attack, while Esther and Cedrik get downed. Edgar uses an ability that switches his initiative with Silvius, who then twin casts cure wounds and brings his two teammates back up. Cedrick, Esther and Edgar then do a tonne of damage to the enemies. After an arduous combat,  Esther takes Carlos out.

They decide to follow Ratti Jr's trail, and take the unconscious Carlos with them. The trail leads them to a prison inside the sewers. There they  decide to take a short rest and interrogate Carlos. Carlos doesn't give much information, other than the fact that Don Ratti is unaware of what Ratti Jrs. is doing in the prision and in general. Then the piece of shit rat mo- sorry. Carlos screams out to alert the prison guards. Cedrik disguises himself as Carlos as he heads towards the prison to calm the guards coming out. Esther is turned invisible by Miri and sneaks inside the prison where "Carlos" is in the process of spinning absurd lies which everyone seems to believe.

"Carlos" talks to Ratti Jr. who mentions that his "friends" would prefer the party dead regardless of whether they know the secrets of this prision. He orders "Carlos" to kill the party as soon as possible. 

After some more lying, Esther and "Carlos" find Mya, an enforcer in the House of Rust, in one of the prisons.

Carlos manages to distract the other people there enough to allow Esther to break Mya out of the prison. The party then meets up, with a newly freed Mya and a gagged and tied Carlos. 

They decided the best way to escape was to squeeze through the disgusting sewage pipes.

While they're crawling inside the pipe, the pipe creaks, and then proceeds the break. They fall into some sewage water in complete darkness. The area is surrounded with giant cockroaches. Combat ensues. Esther helped navigate everyone, and Edgar cast light to illuminate the area.
