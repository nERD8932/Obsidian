We start the session off back in the Rubino Knightclub, where the party (minus Vetri, who had work in the museum) spent the night. however, had some work at the museum. The party is discussing their next course of action, and decide they should have a conversation with the arch-fey , Troupe Master Seven. 

A few minutes after they board the train en-route to the carnival, the train comes to a sudden stop. Outside, they hear Tengai Rin, the Shinpi-Gumi enforcer that tasked Edgar with finding her wife's murderer, call out Esther's name. While the group is discussing their options, Esther lets them know that she doesn't want these bystanders to get involved, and hence is going to head out. Silvius uses his magic to alter his appearance to match Esther, hoping to at least provide some amount of cover. The party exists the train. Outside, they see a large number of Shinpi Gumi members, that sent the train off, after the party exited.

"I thought I had asked you to track down my wife's killer, Mr. Edgar, not enjoy the carnival festivities with her." said Rin, with a voice that was masking much stronger emotions than it let on.

"You're exactly right, miss Rin. Esther was not the one that killed your wife. In fact, she was with us the day your wife was murdered." said Edgar.

"And why should I believe you, a friend of Esther Bishop, over the dozens of eye witness accounts I received?" she replies, as the sight of her lover's killer drives Rin her ever angrier.

Silvius, still disguised as Esther, chimes into the conversation, "Well, by all eyewitness accounts right now, there are two of me, aren't there? Does that mean there are two Esther Bishops, miss Rin?". His argument falls on deaf ears as without another word, the Shinpi Gumi members go on the offensive. A long, and tedious combat ensues, which ends with the party having delt with all of the low ranking members, leaving only Tengai to face the party of five.

At this point, Esther again tries to have Rin see the side of reason. Why would she allow herself to be spotted by so many, when killing Rin's wife? Why would she only knock the Shinpi Gumi out, instead of kill? Why would she come out of the train at all? Rin was neither deterred by the uneven odds, nor the argument Esther made. As she again goes to strike Esther again, she saw Esther drop lower her weapons, in a last, desperate attempt to prove her innocence. Maybe it was the arguments, or maybe it was on a whim, but Rin finally stopped. Without averting her gaze from Esther, she addressed Edgar, "Mr. Edgar, you said she was with you that day?". 

"Yes, with all of us." he replied.

"Two days. Prove that she had nothing to do with my wife's murder in that time."

Without another word, she turns around and starts walking away. 

Afterwards, the party moves all the Shinpi Gumi members off the train tracks, to avoid any accidents, while taking all their gold as the cost of said labor. 

Esther decides she's going to talk to Rorax, who can legally testify that she was actually fighting one of the Ratti family maniacs, Jameson at the time of her wife's murder. Edgar decides to accompany her. 

Silvius, Cedrik and Miri decide they'll head to Troupe Master Seven in the mean time. They make their way over to the carnival where they decide to sneak into the Triton brothers tent, to investigate any evidence they might have left that ties them back to the Formless Beast they fought the other day. Since both the Detective, and the Historian of their party were not with them, Silvius and Cedrik had a slightly difficult time trying to find, well, anything at all, really. However, right as they're leaving, Silvius uses all two braincells and ends up spotting a weird looking crate. Upon further inspection, they find an odd looking Trident in the crate. They decide that they would take this trident with them, even if it wasn't relevant to their investigation just throw a spanner in whatever plans the Triton brothers had for it. 

They then make their way over to the troupe master, who does invite the _three_ of them in. This vexes Karael. As they're about to enter, Karael insistently tells Cedrik to stop, telling him that he needs to get permission for him too, explaining that Seven has a barrier of sorts, and that breaching it would result in unpredictable consequences. While Cedrik doesn't care much about consequences aimed only at Karael, the unpredictable nature of those consequences does give him enough of a reason to call out to Seven, asking for permission for a plus one. After some back and forth, Karael is also granted permission to enter, which they do. 

The party talks to the troupe master about the Formless beast, and how they suspect the Triton brothers of having summoned it. Silvius questions Sevens motives, considering his capabilities as an arch-fey should have given him some insight into these threats. Seven, ignoring the comments instead talks to Cedrik, asking him to introduce this plus one he was asked to additionally invite. Cedrik reluctantly brings Karael out. Following this, the two engage in a mostly cryptic conversation. "Have you forgotten your manners?" says Seven. Karael immediately bows. The two discuss the reasons why Karael is haunting Cedrik, and the details of the last time they met. As the conversation ends, Cedrik tries to pull Karael back inside. But he refused. He stayed out, to make one last comment. "I will never forget what your kind did to mine". With that, he's reabsorbed by Cedrik. Seven then talks about an event taking place tomorrow organized by Vundus. He, like last time, plans on challenging adventurers to engage in combat with his summons. He tasks the party with participating in the event, goading him into summoning abyssal creatures, something which would give Seven enough of a valid reason to cast him out of the Troupe, and likely the realm. The party is a bit unclear about Seven's reasoning and logic, but agree all the same. They head back to Cedrik manor where they try to identify their newly found trident.

Meanwhile, the other party meets up with Rorax to explain to him the task they need his help with. Rorax suggests they get a written letter from Jameson that he was engaged in a fight with them, as that would be clear evidence, considering he would have no motivation to help Esther, one of the people who put him behind bars. Edgar and Esther agree, and go to do exactly that.

After exchanging some hostile conversation with a sill butt-hurt Jameson, Esther ends up goading him into singing the letter by telling him it was his "release forms" and that he could "fight with us" afterward so that they could settle things once and for all. Jameson, the dumbass that he is, acts exactly how they expect him to, and signs the letter without a second thought. They let the poor sod know that he had been tricked, and leave soon after. They immediately take the letter to Tengai Rin, who is in her apartment. As she's shown the letter, she's still a bit distrustful of Edgar and Esther, but with the overwhelming proof and arguments in front of her, she manages to believe them for the time being.

"For what its worth, I am really, really sorry about your wife", says Esther. "She didn't deserve to die. I promise that I'll find the bastard that did this and deliver them to you."

The session ends as the party meets back up at Cedriks manor and discusses what they plan on doing tomorrow.
