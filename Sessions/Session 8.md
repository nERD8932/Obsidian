We start the session the next day in Gwynne Mansion.  It's three days before the exhibition, which is the deadline Gail gave the party to surrender the Varkanus figurine.

Silvius, Vetri and Miri head to the college to create one convincing, and one not-so-convincing fake. They both get really high rolls and manage to create both with some effort.

Meanwhile, Esther goes to the Rubino bar, where she inquires about the Shinpi-Gumi, especially about the murder she's being currently framed for. She's told by Giovanni, the current second in command, that while he doesn't know much, Luciano did share a lot of his secrets about rival gangs and their dealings with Diego, who might be able to help with this situation. They speculate the various groups that might want to frame Esther. Giovanni seems to think its the Ratti's, but they don't have any solid leads.

We also have Vetri, Cedrik and Edgar heading to the museum, where they meet Berion Goldquill. Berion inquires about Edgars' mother, and why Edgar is still in Sombus. Edgar tells him about how he's investigating his fathers death, and how he doesn't think it was a suicide. Berion looks somewhat unconvincingly surprised, as he tells Edgar to meet him on the weekend, so that they can have a conversation about his father. The group also informs Berion of the fact that the exhibition will be raided in some way, and that the museum needs to improve the security. While Berion does seem concerned, the party feels that he knows more than he's letting on, for both the situations they discussed.

Miri also makes it a point to warn their parents when they visit home, due the threats Gail made.

We then cut to Thursday evening, the night of the exhibition. The party meets at the museum, where they're greeted by Vetri, who was already there as part of her job. Everyone is dressed in nice clothes.

Berion makes a speech, thanking the organizers, including Vetri. He then goes around the room, describing the artifacts on display.

and last, but most importantly:

The Sarcophagus of the Serpent "Vanos"

"Here you see our museum's possibly most prized possession, the sarcophagus of the serpent vanos. VANOS WAKHOTEP was the high priest of the Makheti Pharaoh MATHEP IX in the 2nd century 1st era, two thousand years ago. He was given the title of "the Serpent", however by all historical accounts he was simply a human. His name was simply WAKHOTEP, which means "Varkanus' Satisfaction", for he was a devout servant of Varkanus. The name VANOS or WANOS was a nickname given to him by foreigners that he historically accepted. As the high priest of Makhet, he taught the Pharaoh's two children: the young prince MASRET V, and the young adoptive princess, SHHAYA SURYA. It is believed that it was VANOS who taught SHHAYA magic, both the dark arts and the divine. It was under his leadership that the people of Makhet thought the young Shhaya as a divine rebirth of the primordial goddess SORYA... He was known to be a broker of power and magic, a high priest of the gods that was capable of spellcraft even the gods were afraid of. When MASRET V ascended the throne of Makhet as its last pharaoh, he was biased against VANOS as a devout follower of MAASET, MAGMUS; as well as due to the favoritism VANOS showed SHHAYA over MASRET. The army of the Pharaoh bound Vanos, and mummified him alive for his demon worship. Of course, a few years later, Vanos' former student SHHAYA would kill her brother MASRET, and transfrom Makhet into Kasaaq as SOL SULTANA."

Silvius, curious about the Sarcophagus, asks Berion as to why Varkanus never revived Vanos. Berion brings Professor Triston into the conversation, who answers Silvius's question. Triston explains that there wasn't much of him to bring back.

Once the conversation slows down, Vetri goes to meet her brother, Viraj. They talk about their parents, the exhibition et cetera. She then introduces her brother to the party. 

Esther realizes she's seen Viraj before, with Luciano. While she never interacted with him directly, she does remember a few details of the night Once Viraj leaves, Esther pulls Vetri aside, who is munching on kebabs, and tells her of Viraj's meeting with Luciano. They talk about dropping this nuke during thanks giving.

After some more mingling. the party finds themselves talking to MP Autumn Bates and Mr. Svazzall, the owner of the Planar Pub. They make some conversation with Cedrik. Autumn talks about Cedriks association with Emperor Sombra, and how she heard that Cedrik got injured on some mission. Cedrik shuts the conversation down politely. Cedrik also goes up to Clara, to talk to her about the letter he had Azukk send to her. He also mentions how the "situation" he finds himself in should end today, and if that something weird happens in the museum, she should leave safely and carefully. Clara appreciates the concern, but brushes it off, explaining that she prefers honesty over apprehension, like what was shown by Silvius. 

The night goes on, some people have left by this point. Esther notices the student, Connor Chambers, noting down the text written the VN Abyssal A artifact. Silvius after some convincing drags the party to Conner, to start a conversation, when they realize he's reading the full script out in Abyssal. As he does this, large amounts of smoke emits from the sarcophagus next to them.  The smoke seems to coalesce into pharaoh. Combat ensues.

During combat, the party sees the "souls" or "life force" of the dead nobles enter the sarcophagus, and create another pharaoh specter. Edgar also saves MP Autumn's life, who later wishes to giver her gratitude. After a long and arduous combat, where many civilians died, it ends with Conner casting fireball centered on himself. He is heavily hurt, but alive.

By this point, Gail, along with the rest of the officers are at the scene. Gail kills the last pharaoh servant, and promptly steals Conner's notebook. Silvius and the others lie about the origin of the enemies to temporarily save Connor's skin. 

Vetri also subtly lets Berion know to remain cautious around Gail.

Vetri and Silvius head to the hospital with Connor, where they stay in his room to make sure Gail, or the other cultists don't kill him. Since Vetri's dad is on call at the hospital, she catches him up on what happened. He seems to think the exhibition went well, which, to his credit, wasn't completely incorrect. Kinda. Maybe. 

We then cut back to the other part of the group. Gail comes up to them. and asks about the whereabouts of the figurine. Cedrik lies and tells her its with Vetri. Gail is rage baited once again, this time by Esther, and leaves soon after.

The group also sees a reporter walking up to them, who asks them about the incident. After giving somewhat factual information, they're also asked if their party has a name they wish to be referred by. The party unanimously agrees to go with "Six Reasons Why". Why, you ask? Glad you asked:
1. Esthy,
2. Silvi,
3. Mori,
4. Vatre,
5. Ledgar,
and last but not least,
6. Medrik

Esther and Edgar also share a conversation, where they discuss the details of what Edgar knows about his father death. Esther offers her help with his investigation as she wants to return the favor of his help with her investigation.

Meanwhile, Cedrik goes to Clara, to talk to her about what happened today. Clara asks him about what exactly happened  today and about what caused the incident, which he vaguely clarifies. She then asks him if he's going to continue and try to fight his battles on his own, even though, she is and always had been open to help. He says yes, but also mentions that while his actions are rooted in an attempt to keep Clara safe, he doesn't think that those facts need to be at odds with each other. He wishes to change this about himself, and hopefully be able to be more honest with Clara in the future. Clara gives him a genuine smile, and wishes him the best with that.

We then cut back to Silvius and Vetri, who are figuring out how to trick Gail. They rehearse for a little bit, at which point Gail walks into the room they're in. Silvius actively rage baits her while Vetri asks for whatever information she has about this incident and the figurine. They end up getting Connors notebook, but two of the more important pages were missing. 

After she demands the figurine, they hand her the badly made fake version, which they made at the university earlier. Once she sees through the lie, the also give her the well made fake version, which seems to fool her for now. They briefly follow her, finding out that she's headed to the train station again, and head back to the hospital in order to stay with Connor for the night.

The session ends with the start of a new day, where the party members in Gwynne Manor are reading todays newspaper. The headline reads:

"Six Reasons Why Saves The Day!"
