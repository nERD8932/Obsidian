We start the session where we left off. After the festivities end, Edgar, who was invited by Vundus to meet with him, is headed to his tent. The rest of the party decides to hide either in or around the tent. Miri hides ends up hiding inside Edgars pocket, and Vetri casts Invisibility and heads inside the tent with Edgar. Cedrik, Esther and Silvius hide outside.

As Edgar enters, he's greeted by a smiling Vundus, who seems to be cleaning a knife. 

"So, what is it you want from me, Edgar?". 

"You see, my father; he was obsessed with Varkanus." says Edgar, trying to deceive him by telling him that he wishes to form a similar connection. 

"Well, the version of Varkys people worship here is ...different from the one we worship." 

Vundus also asks him whether he's a member of the Sombian sect of the Church of Blood. He talks about wanting to mend their relationship with the sect. He also mentions hearing of a "new church leader" in town, and about rumors of Varkanus himself is guiding this sect.

Edgar lies about being a member of the church, but clarifies that he doesn't believe that Varkanus is guiding the church, and that he's instead more interested in version of Varkanus  Vundus hinted at earlier. At this point, Edgar sees an incredibly large Triton carrying a battle-axe come into the tent.

Afterwards, Vundus then cuts to the chase.  
"You're here to collect an artifact from me, aren't you?"

Edgar shrugs. "Ah, you've found me out it seems."

Vundus seems pleased with himself. "Well that's always been how our groups operate, right? You give me a lot of money and I give you artifacts."

He asks Edgar if he knows the artifact he's supposed to collect. Edgar again lies by claiming that his superiors didn't give him that information. Vundus then takes out a necklace of "Varkys", quoting a price of forty thousand gold coins.

Edgar tells Vundus to collect his money in the alternate realm of the train station. After seeing a confused look on Vundus's face, Edgar tells Vundus about the train station and its passphrase, and how the church here stays in touch through it. Vundus seems to understand and tells him he'll visit the station tomorrow.

After taking the necklace, Edgar brings up his father, and his name, Allan Starling, to see if it triggers reaction from the pair. And just like he wanted, Veresko does react, with unbridled rage.

"_YOUR_ father is _ALLAN STARLING?_" asks an enraged Veresko.

"You _are_ part of the cult, aren't you?", asks Vundus, looking more confused than he did earlier. "And your father, he said he was a _worshipper_ of Varkys? _He_ told you that?" he says while trying to calm his brother down.

"Yes, he did. Why are you so surprised?" he replies. "He was part of the church.  And sixteen years ago, he met with Tritons at this exact fair, after which he mysteriously commit suicide."

"Your father gave us a lot of trouble." says Vundus, still trying to assess the situation.

The tension in the room clearly rises as Edgar gets increasingly angry and suspicious of their answers. He then outright asks them if they killed Allan.

At this point, Veresko interjects and says "We DIDN'T kill Allan Starling, but I WISH we had!". 

Edgar, who is equalparts enraged, and curious starts probing them for more information, trying to get them to slip up and admit their involvement in his fathers' murder. Tension reaches a breaking point, Veresko reaches for his axe and is about to take a swing at Edgar. As this happens, the rest of the party immediately spring into action. Their sudden appearance was startling enough to stop Veresko from swinging his axe any further. The party attempts to de-escalate the situation through a show of force while posing as other members of the church. Silvius told the Tritons that an attack on Edgar of them would be considered an attack on the church, prompting immediate retaliation. Vundus, who had seen them kill an abberant shark a few hours earlier, likely didn't want to take those chances, nor did he want to further deteriorate relations with the church.   

In an attempt to defuse the situation, Vundus tells Edgar about their meeting with his father sixteen years ago. Allan Starling was supposed to buy the Aethian Varkys Figurine from them but cancelled the deal once he found out that they were cultists. Furthermore, he claimed that Allan actually stole the figurine from them and sent it off somewhere. The brothers captured and tortured him on someones behest, before sending him off to that third party, where he was actually killed.

Edgar cracks down on their thinly veiled attempt to hide their invovment, telling them that even if they didn't directly kill Allan Starling, his blood was very much on their hands. Then, with the part back-up, he demands the names of the people that instructed the brothers to capture Allan, offering to help find and return the figurine for their cooperation. Vundus doesn't give up names, feigning ignorance, but says he may be willing to part with more information if Edgar brings him the figurine first. As the party is leaving the tent, Veresko confesses that he enjoyed his father's screams. Edgar mentally vows to see these two siblings dead.

Everyone seems to be trying to wrap their head around the situation. Esther proceeds to take her glove off and lightly  slap Edgar with it. She scolds him for being reckless, which he accepts. She then gives him a well deserved hug.  Silvius tells Edgar to not blame himself, since anyone in that situation would be reckless, likely a lot more than Edgar was. The party continue to try and comfort Edgar, who still seems shaken up. They decide that they all desperately needed drinks, and since the Rubino Knightclub in Fayshine, owned and operated by Esther's mafia family was nearby, they decide to head there.

At the club, the party sits down to have a few drinks. Vetri asks Giovanni about his recollection of her brother, Viraj's meeting with Luciano.  Giovanni describes what he remembers, telling them that Viraj had seemingly commissioned a tool or service through Luciano. The first meeting was mostly to discuss the details of the same, while the second was after the "project" was done, to express his gratitude.

After a bit of banter, Esther decides its time she open up about her situation with the doppelganger. She says she wanted to keep this to herself as it didn't concern the party or their mission, but since things might escalate thought it might be best to warn them. Silvius proceeds to take Esthers glove off and slap her with it. He, and the party then scold her for hiding this from them, trying to deal with it on her own. Esther says that she didn't want to dump her problems on the rest of them. Silvius tells Esther that they'd just help Esther make that load a little lighter, Edgar joins in. "If you guys hadn't been there helping me today, I probably would have died in that tent." 

Esther does genuinely realize her mistake, much like Edgar did, and apologizes to the party, promising that while this is new to her, she'd do better in the future.

The next day, the party spends their time enjoying the carnival by playing games, eating cotton-candy, attending performances et cetera. They even called in some friends including Oscar for Miri's performance later. They did not see the Valexath siblings at all that day. 

Later in the evening, Miri had her four-part performance. In it, she cast Spirit Guardians, Faerie Fire, Rope Trick, and other spells to boost her performance and the songs she played on her Saxaboom. The performance was a roaring success.

An hour later during the performance of the Great Fairy Bard Toffee, Esther felt uneasy, almost spotting something in the sky above the stage but nothing was there. Vetri thought that Esther was feeling uneasy from the crowd, so they stepped out for just a moment before Karael told Cedrik something was actually wrong and to touch the Varkys Figurine. 

Upon doing so, Cedrik took some psychic damage but enter a 'Paused-Time' state. Everyone and everything was frozen in space-time, except for him. The world also seemed to be coated in a green light.

As he turned to the rest of the rest of the party, they also enter this state. Part of the party then see an aberrant Formless Beast floating in the sky above. They can clearly sense it consuming the joy and memories of the entire crowd around it.

Combat ensues. The party fights the beast, as Cedrik brings it to the ground with his Ethereal chains. Miri and Silvius both light it up with fireballs as the rest of the party continues to deal damage to it. 

After an arduous few rounds, the party manages to defeat the aberrant monster. As they do so, the flow of time seems to return to normal. For the bystanders, Edgar seems to have randomly and instantaneously  teleported on the stage. He quickly misty-steps' out to avoid a scene. 

The party discussed what had happened and wondered if they should talk to Troupemaster Seven. Silvius mentions that an arch-fey is bound to know the presence of a formless beast that is targeting people in their vicinity. They decide that they should have a conversation with him at some point, regardless of whether it was the Valexath siblings or the Troupemaster himself that summoned the beast.

Meanwhile, Esma and Miri's parents met up with Miri, praising her performance. Esma tells her that her performance garnered enough people to more than make up for her performer's fee. She gives her around five thousand gold, and even offers her a job with the troupe. She still has a few years for her to consider, since the troupe would be on break for at least a year after this week. 

The Great Fairy Bard Toffee, one of Miri's main inspirations growing up, also shows up to praise an extremely starstruck Miri.  The session ends as Toffee enchants her Saxaboom with Fae magic by autographing it.
