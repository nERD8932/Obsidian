We begin with a slight retcon. We see [[Cedrik]] wake up in the morning after the warehouse incidentᵀᴹ. Cedrick hears a strange but familiar voice saying "It has been a while hasn't it?". Cedrick, startled, but unsurprised responds. The entity talks about how Cedrick seems to forget them when convenient. Cedrick asks what it wants, to which it says "You know what I want.". Cedrick refuses, seemingly as usual. The entity talks about its immortality at which point Cedrik hits his head on the wall, and the voice stops.

We jump back to the living room where [[Richard Rorax]] is waiting for them. Rorax reassures everyone that no-one here is a suspect, but asks everyone to clarify their relations to the deceased one again, just to make sure. Everyone clarifies their relations. Vetri ends up divulging her encounter in the ware house. Silvius also mentions Cedrik and his encounter in the art studio. Miri unintentionally divulges Esther and their weird encounter with the abyssal monstrosity. 

Rorax summarizes the events that took place late last night (or early morning, technically). He also mentions that the police seem to be uninterested in investigating this further, deeming the incident "a mafia meeting gone wrong". Silvius takes issue to their lack of interest, which Esther finds amusing. Ester has Rorax light a cigarette, and exclaims "and we have an alliance". Rorax gives everyone sending stones (read Walkie-Talkie), and tells the party to feel free to investigate further, since they're the only ones interested. Everyone is agrees. 

Silvius calls out Roraxs' thinly veiled racism, as he leaves.

He also introduces [[Gailhel 'Gail' Redeye]], a drow investigator of the central district of the city. 
Both Vetri and Esther know of her, and know her to have contacts. 

Once everyone leaves, Edgar asks Cedrik for a private conversation. They discuss how Cedrik seems pale since the morning, which he promptly brushes off. Edgar also tells Cedrik that he can be trusted. Cedrik vaguely clarifies his "situation". Edgar lets Cedrik know that it would be better if he were to open up to everyone. They also talk about the case at hand, and how Edgars father, [[Allan Starling]]s' journal may give some insights into the case. 

They disclose this information to the party.

Silvius also realizes that he was painting the "true essence" of Cedrik, which seems to be something angelic.

The party splits into (Edgar, Esther and Cedrik) and (Silvius, Vetri and Miri). 

Edgar and co. head to castella, to meet his Ratti contact. They talk about Edgars connections to different mafia families. They go over to the Planar Pub. they meet Alice Fayman, who seems to know Edgar. They introduce each other and make some small talk.

They see [[Bruno]], a higher up member of the Ratti mafia family.

Cedrik seems to stand out a little bit, and tries to compensate orders a drink with a pirate voice. Surprisingly, that doesn't work. Meanwhile, Edgar and Esther take a beer over to Bruno who receives them with a ʷᵃʳᵐ ᵍʳᵉᵉᵗᶦⁿᵍ. Cedrik sits nearby, enough to be able to overhear the conversation. Esther unintentionally gives away the fact that they were at the warehouse yesterday, but they're able to deceive their way through the conversation. Bruno clarifies that the Rattis weren't involved the killings. Meanwhile, as the conversation goes on, Cedrik meanwhile, finds himself sitting next to [[Mr. Svazzall Luminus]], the owner of the Planar Pub. Cedrik lies about his name, introducing himself as 𝒢𝓌ℯ𝒹𝓇𝒾𝓀. Svazzal asks 𝒢𝓌ℯ𝒹𝓇𝒾𝓀 what he's doing at an establishment like this. 𝒢𝓌ℯ𝒹𝓇𝒾𝓀 spins up some story.  Cedrik divulges his actual name, and gives him a napkin with his postal address. 

Meanwhile, Bruno talks about [[Don Rico Ratti]], and how it was through the Don that they got intel about yesterdays incident. Bruno also talks about the Dons daughters wedding which is happening this week, and even offers to invite them. He hands them a singular wedding invitation which read: "Angelica Ratti is getting married to Kaya Nezumi". 

As this happens, Esther gets a message on one of the Rubino sending stones. Lucianos'. The sending stone operator asks about "Luciano's" whereabouts, and talks about a turf war with the Rattis. Esther clarifies that Luciano is already dead. The group then heads out.

With that done, we now switch to the other group, headed to Sombus Archeological Museum (S.A.M) in Starsworth, the unofficial "art district" of the city. They head into the museum, where the guard stops them for a second but lets them by after some convincing from Silvius and Yetri.

They get stopped by a Clockwork archivist, but again deceive their way past it. They see that the door to the office is locked, which Silvius promptly "gommages" with his Entropic Touch.

They find a live portrait of Martin painted by Silvius' parents. They question the portrait, which Miri intimidates into telling the truth. They find that the police has already been there, and has taken some letters and 3 books already, which is why they found the office to be devoid of any important information.  They contact the other group and head to Martins house in Hyrden.

After catching up, Silvius paints himself to look like Inspector Richard Rorax, and deceives the receptionist into giving them the key to the apartment. They enter and start investigating. Esther finds 
Ester finds 10 gold bars, and Vetri finds a hidden room that has a tonne of documents and a safe.

With all their powers combined (Guidance, Bardic Inspiration, and Inspiration Inspiration), they open the safe. They find money, more documents and a statuette artifact:

2200+ Years Old Figurine
Aethian Make
of the Blood God, Varkanus

![Varkanus Statuette](/Images/Vstatue.png)

Vetri takes the statuette with doubly gloved hands.

As this happens, the party hears someone enter the apartment. Silrax Esmer-Richard and 𝒢𝓌ℯ𝒹𝓇𝒾𝓀 head outside to see who it is. They meet Gailhel Redeye, and her investigators, who they met earlier in the morning. During the confrontation, Gail casts dispel magic on Rorax, revealing that it was infact, Silvius. Everyone is shocked and gasps.

The situation is pretty tense. Gail asks the two if they're alone and if they found anything of importance. They deceive her and tell her that they're alone and didn't find anything. She looks relieved, and tries to eye up Silvius. She tells the two to leave. They agree. As Silvius and Cedrik are headed to make their way out, Silvius senses danger. He gets shot in the back of the head and takes 23 points of damage. Combat ensues.

After combat, they tied up the assailants, and end the session.
