"Archaeological Beginnings": 
While working away at the Sombus Archaeological Museum, [Vetri](/Party/Vetri.md) and [Oscar Ortez](/The%20City/Oscar%20Ortez.md) were approached by their boss Berion Goldquill as well as the president of the society, [Martin Candlewynd](/The%20City/Martin%20Candlewynd.md). They told them that they were setting up a new exhibition in a few weeks called the "Artifacts of Demonology". Their first task was to go down to the society's warehouse in Oldwharf and find an old figurine labelled "VN-2" from the messy storage. Oscar owed a favor to Edgar Starling (for getting his stalker ex off of his back) so he called in Edgar as well. In Castella, Edgar saw his landlady Mrs. Perez yell at one of his orc neighbours for being late on rent. She warned Edgar that she didn't appreciate his "Cop friend" from coming to the building. On his way to meet Oscar, Edgar ran into Inspector Rorax and had a chat with him at the sausage stall. Edgar, Vetri, and Oscar met at the Birch Coffee House and got to know each other. The three headed down via tram to the Archaeological Society's warehouse, where the lazy security guard let them in. While searching for the artifact, Edgar found an old work notebook written by his father, Allan Starling, who used to work at the society before his death. Vetri found VN-2, which looked like a legitimate demonic artifact to her. She handed it to Oscar who set it down. The sunset light coming in from the windows put the artifact into darkness, which then also got triggered by Vetri and Oscar touching it directly. It summoned a large demonic snake who almost killed Vetri, but the three together took it down. Oscar wrapped up the artifact in cloth and gave it to Vetri, and the three split ways back in Dragolyn.
