We open the session with a recap, about how Gail and her comrades had symbols of the God of Blood, Varkanus.

Esther kicks a knocked out Gail with her boot, and wakes her up. They then proceeded to try and intimidate her; she resists. The group ask her what happened at the warehouse to which she says Martin got into trouble and that she was simply "cleaning up the mess".

After this exchange, she utters something in Abyssal; 
"Om Eyriusgodus ax Eyrius" of "Blood for the Blood God"

All four of the assailants vomit blood and die on the spot.

The gang discusses what the implications are and whether they need to clean up the mess or not. They also look over the documents they got, now that they know the connection to Varkanus. They found:

 - MARTIN'S SOURCES LIST: Most Abyssal Artifacts have source: "X"
 - Letter from Xarkos

Vetri cast Comprehend Languages and while reading the letter took some damage after failing a saving throw due to some arcane magic.

She read out the letter to every one:
_"CANDLEWYND YOUR BORROWED TIME IS COMING TO A CLOSE. GIVE US THE HOLY FIGURE. GIVE US THE ALPHABET. VARKANUS HIMSELF REQUIRES TO MEET YOU AGAIN. THE EXHIBITION MUST CONTINUE."_

Vetri and Silvius saw the heavy implications of Martin having met Varkanus already.

Silvius sketches the scene, and casts prestidigitation on everyone, and everyone heads back to where they need to be.

Miri goes back to her parents and lets them know they're fine

Esther, on finding that Don Rubino isn't in town right now, lets Terzo Sombosso know of the situation, who lets her know that incase there is a fight with the Rattis, she needs to conceal the fact that shes a Rubino.

Cedrik has another conversation with the entity inside him. It admits that it doesn't want Cedrik to die just yet. It tries to convince Cedrik to give him control, in order to protect them both. He also talks to his butler

Silvius meets Nora and tells her about what he's been up to, minus the dangerous bits. He also tells Professor Clara about the shady stuff around Professor Loras's death, and how Cedrick is also investigating this with him. She mumbles to herself and says that maybe she needs to look into this as well.

Vetri talks to Oscar, and deceives him about the details of what happened after he left. After a few hours, she inspects the figurine she got from the vault back at Martins flat. The figurine seems to be from The Aethian Dominion underwater, who follow the god Aethys, sometimes called the sister of Varkanus. Aethians are known to HATE Varkanus, which makes it extremely blasphemous. 

After a few hours, when Oscar is about to leave, he notices one of the Cogwork Archivist seems to be malfunctioning, and tells Vetri. Vetri checks up on the archivist, and senses danger. She then calls the group

The gang meets up at the museum and discusses what to do about the archivist.

After trying to sneak up on the archivist, it starts to run and casts a magic spell on a T-Rex skeleton. Combat Ensues.

Silvius and Vetri try to set off a cannon in the room,

Cedrik is mortally wounded, and in response lets the entity, now known as KARAEL, out, to use his power.

Silvius sets off the cannon and does 68 damage to the T-Rex

Edgar gets the final blow on the T-Rex, and Vetri gets the final blow on the Archivist.

Vetri checks the damage to the Cogworks Archivist and decides she needs help from an prosthetics artificer friend, Xoe Yizuko, to fix it. The gang carries the broken bits with them to Arkwich, where the friend is.

They bring the body of the archivist up to her lab, where some of the party realize the lingering tension between Esther and Xoe is because they used to date. 

When the three Artificers inspect the body of the archivist, its made clear that it was modified by another artificer, within the past week, AND said artificer was probably within the museum at the time of the malfunction.

The gang mentions their encounter with a cult of Varkanus. Xoe talks about her experience with similar cults of Varkanus, where her previous master, Naoko Genso, became a devotee of Varkanus. She also talks about investigating another lead.

The session ends when the gang decide to leave Xoe to her devices (literally) so that she can fix the Cogworks Archivist. Esther however, did end up going back for a second to say her goodbyes to Xoe properly.
