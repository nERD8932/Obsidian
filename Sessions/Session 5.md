The session starts with the gang discussing Cedriks fleshrot. Cedriks seems to be unconcerned about it at the moment. They hear sounds from the room they locked in Carlos in. They discuss what to "ask" him. By this time, Vetri also arrives at the mansion. She takes a look at Cedriks rotting flesh, and talks about taking him to the hospital. Cedrik insists on calling someone to the mansion instead. Vetri then sends a message to her father, which Tuskon takes to Vetri's dad.

Miri casts Zone of Truth, and the gang then questions Carlos. 

Upon questioning, Carlos says that Rico is trying to expand his network, and the things he's doing is mainly to get money. He also says Rico claimed that he met Varkanus. Silvius asks him about who is paying Rico to capture or kill our group. He seems hesitant to respond, but after some persuasion mentions the only person he met from the group at the Planar Pub, a redhead around the same age as Silvius.

Silvius makes the connection to Selda Hightower, and talks about his encounter with the father daughter duo with the group. Some of the group knows of their existence, but not much more. 

After extracting all the information they can, the gang discusses what to actually do with their captive friend. Esther wants to kill Carlos, and the rest of the gang wants to let him free (after some mild dismemberment). After some deliberation, they decide to turn him into the police.

In the meantime, Tuskon returns with Vetri's dad,

Rakta looks over Cedrik while they make some extremely awkward conversation. He then takes out a vial of Cure Disease, and asks Cedrik about how he caught this disease. Cedrik lies about how ended up in sewage. Rakta instructs Cedrik to take care of himself due to his old age, and then leaves.

While this was going on, Esther asks Edgar and Silvius whether they have ever killed anyone before. Edgar mentions that he planned on doing some killing of his own sometime back. Esther is intrigued and offers her services to Edgar, if he ever needed them.

They meet up with Cedrik and Vetri. Vetri looks like she just swam through sewage and fought large cockroaches.

The gang discusses selling off the spoils of war theyve collected over the past few days. Silvius mentions he needs to replenish is paining supplies. Cedrik tells him Clara left some supplies in her studio, and told him to help himself to anything. Silvius takes him up on that, and ends up finding:

Vetri receives word from Xoe about an updat she has about the Cogwork Archivist. They then head to Yizuko Labs, to talk to Xoe. She said she looked up the original blueprints, and cross-referenced it with the body of the archivist. She saw that there was a single modification, a small pink psionic shard, which the rouge artificer must have used to control the archivist. Xoe also reversed the polarity of the crystal, which now will resonate if it is in proximity to its counterpart.

They assume that an artificer from the museum could have intimate enough access to the archivists to be able to modify them in this way, and decide to visit the museum sometime.

Xoe also gives Vetri some gloves she said might help her:

She also gives Esther a weapon Esther seemed to have spoken to her about back when they were together:

After giving Esther and Xoe a slightly hard time, the gang travels to Lighton to meet Esther's contact for illegal magic items,

Everyone buys upgrades for themselves after selling off the gold bars and other items.

They then head to the university to talk to Selda. On their way, the encounter Jamison and other members of the Ratti family.

"GIVE ME BACK MY TOTALLY STRAIGHT, NOT HOMO EROTIC BUDDY" says Jamison, probably.

Combat ensues.

After some tedious combat where everyone makes use of their new items and abilities, Vetri gets the final blow on Jamison, knocking him out. They pick up two bombs from him, and call Rorax to get him and Carlos arrested. 

Since the gang is near Edgars office, they stop by there, where Edgar gets promptly scolded by his landlord.

Esther and Silvius decide to stay back at Edgars office and spend the night. Esther tries to shoot her shot, Silvius acts as a chaperone. 

Silvius also paints a barrier tattoo on himself, taking some help from Edgar and Esther in the process. The session ends as the party levels up.
