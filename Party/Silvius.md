“Most children in [[Sombus]] are born with silver spoons. He was born with a golden paintbrush." 

Silvius Esmer-Gradus was born in the year 3E497, in the Crimson city of [[Sombus]]. Born to two of the most well regarded artists in the recent century of [[Abmarah]], he was no stranger to the savoir faire of nobles. 

He’s a pretty happy go lucky character, and always seems like his head’s in the clouds. He enjoys the company of others, but finds relating to those around him a little difficult. He’s most comfortable around this one live painting of a historical figure in one of the mansion rooms (the Esmer-Gradus Mansion in Faithills is filled with live paintings of people and places). He’s pretty well connected to the Crimsons by virtue of his parents. He has a tonne of friends like [[Norah Ward]] in college, due to his fame. He is motivated by beauty and perfectionism to a fault. He hasn’t known struggle or combat.
