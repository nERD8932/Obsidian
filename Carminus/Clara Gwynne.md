She works as the head Professor of Art and Elemental Magic at the [[Carminus Universum]]. She's the professor [[Silvius]] works directly under most of the time. Her artwork is not as famous as Silvius's parents, of course, but she's still a highly regarded artist in the Sombian art scene and he's still got much to learn from her.

Also the wife of [[Cedrik]]
