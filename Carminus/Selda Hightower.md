![../Images/Selda1.jpg](/Images/Selda1.jpg)


Selda Hightower, daughter of [[Triston Hightower]], is a student at [[Carminus Universum]]. She's a rude high born, who tries to bully people along with her lackeys.

In [[../Sessions/Session 5|Session 5]], the party found out that she apparently met with Rico Ratti Jr. 

In [[../Sessions/Session 6|Session 6]], after fighting her in a different plane, where she claimed to be in contact with [[../The City/Varkanus|Varkanus]] himself through a large eye in the center of the city's X, she revealed information about the cult, including the names of Xarkos and Trixie, claiming that she's only in the cult for power.
