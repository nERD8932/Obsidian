Professor Tristan Hightower is the Professor of Divine Studies & Planes at the [[Carminus Universum]]. He is also the father of [[Selda Hightower]]. He's a follower of Varkanus, and takes a keen interest in everything related. 

Silvius once approached him with a question related to the cult of Varkanus, which seemed to interest him greatly. He, to the best of the party's knowledge, does not know of his daughters connection to the cult.
