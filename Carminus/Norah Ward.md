Norah Ward 
Human F 19

![[Norah Ward.jpg]]

Another Art & Sorcery student at the University. In the year he's spent there, Norah has essentially become [[Silvius]]'s closest friend. She's introverted and not as popular, but somehow just by sitting next to each other in class they've become friends. She's from a much poorer background than Silvius, but has managed to make her way to the class on basis of her art prowess instead of nepotism (not that Silvius's art isn't good, but he can't deny that his parents essentially just bought him into the University)

Hesitant to visit [[Silvius]] because she's shy of the people there.
